# Lab - Class 02
## Project: math-series

Author: Sarah Glass for Python 401

## Overview
* Use TDD practices - write tests first, then implement code. Make small changes with many cycles of Red-Green-Refactor.
* Create a fibonacci function with docstring that returns nth value in fibonacci series using recursion or iteration.
* Create a lucas function with docstring returning the nth value in the lucas series using recursion or iteration.
* Create a function called sum_series with one required parameter and two optional parameters. The required will determine which element to print. The optionals will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.
